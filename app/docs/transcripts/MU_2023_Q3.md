**Sanjay Mehrotra**

Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered fiscal third quarter revenue within our guidance range with gross margin and EPS above the range. The ongoing improvement of customer inventories and memory content growth are driving higher industry demand while production cuts across the industry continue to help reduce excess supply. As a result, pricing trends are improving, and we have increased confidence that the industry has passed the bottom for both quarterly revenue and year-on-year revenue growth.

Our technology leadership and strengthening product portfolio position us well across diverse growth markets, including AI and memory-centric computing. Beyond this downturn, we expect to see record TAM in calendar 2025, along with a return to more normalized levels of profitability.

The impact of the May 24 decision by the Cyberspace Administration of China on Micron's business remains uncertain and fluid. Several Micron customers, including mobile OEMs have been contacted by certain critical information infrastructure operators or representatives of the government in China concerning the future use of Micron products.

As discussed before, Micron's revenue with companies headquartered in Mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors, accounts for approximately 1/4 of Micron's worldwide revenue and remains the principal exposure. We currently estimate that approximately half of that China headquartered customer revenue, which equates to a low double-digit percentage of Micron's worldwide revenue, is at risk of being impacted.

This significant headwind is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. Micron is working to mitigate this impact over time and expect increased quarter-to-quarter revenue variability. Micron's long-term goal is to retain its worldwide DRAM and NAND share.

Turning to technology. Micron continues to lead the industry in both DRAM and NAND technology. We are investing prudently to maintain our technology competitiveness while managing CapEx, node ramps and wafer start reductions to reduce our bit supply and align it with demand. Our industry-leading 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND nodes are achieving world-class yields and the yield ramp for these nodes has been faster than any of our prior nodes. These leadership nodes provide a strong cost capability along with best-in-class power and performance specifications that will be leveraged across the portfolio of DRAM and NAND products.

In fiscal Q3, we achieved several important product qualifications on these advanced nodes and are well positioned to ramp them in fiscal 2024. We are also making good progress towards the introduction of our EUV-based 1-gamma node in 2025. This node will be manufactured first in our Taiwan site, where we already have EUV capability installed and operating in preparation for this ramp.

We also recently announced plans to bring EUV technology to our fab in Hiroshima, Japan with support from the Japanese government. Micron will be the first company to bring EUV technology to Japan for production.

We are also advancing our global assembly and test network in order to support our product portfolio and extend our ability to deliver on global customer demand in the future. In China, we announced an investment of approximately $600 million over the next several years in our operations in Xian. This builds on our long history of significant investment in our Xian assembly, packaging and test operations.

As a part of this investment, we have decided to purchase the assembly equipment of our partner, Power Tech Semiconductor Xian, who has been operating inside our Xian facility for the last 8 years. We also intend to construct a new building at our Xian site to provide space to add more product capabilities. This will allow us, over time, to serve more of the demand from our customers in China from the Xian site.

In India, with the strong support of the Indian government, we will build a new assembly and test facility in Gujarat to address demand for the latter half of this decade. We are also increasing our investments in assembly and test capacity in Taiwan for high-bandwidth memory products as we gear up for stronger demand in this segment, driven by the AI wave.

Now turning to our end markets. Customers continue to make progress in reducing their excess inventory in fiscal Q3. Most customer inventories in the PC and smartphone segments are close to normal levels now consistent with our forecast 6 months ago. Some of these inventory levels can get distorted by customer attempts to leverage current prices, which are deemed to be transient and unsustainable at these levels to purchase additional volumes before prices rise significantly. Data center customer inventory is also improving and will likely normalize around the end of this calendar year or somewhat thereafter, depending on the growth in traditional data center spending.

In data center, we saw strong sequential revenue growth in both cloud and enterprise in fiscal Q3, driven by some recovery from depressed sales levels in fiscal Q2. The recent acceleration in the adoption of generative AI is driving higher-than-expected industry demand for memory and storage for AI servers, while traditional server demand for mainstream data center applications continues to be lackluster.

Micron's product portfolio and road map of innovative products position us to capture growth opportunities from AI and data-centric computing architectures for both training and inferencing. Increasingly large AI models with an exponentially growing number of parameters are driving demand for dramatically higher memory content.

As we have said before, AI servers have 6x to 8x the DRAM content of a regular server and 3x the NAND content. In fact, some customers are deploying AI compute capability with a substantially higher memory content. A striking example is NVDL, DGX, GH 200 supercluster, which shows just how memory-intensive AI workloads can be. It provides developers the ability to support giant models with a massive shared memory space of 144 terabytes.

A significant majority of that memory footprint is enabled by a joint development project between our 2 companies that extends Micron's low-power DRAM leadership to server-class applications. We are proud to pioneer this differentiated LP DRAM innovation to deliver a significant reduction in data center power consumption compared to DDR-based solutions helping to support our customers' green initiatives.

High-bandwidth memory used in high-performance computing is seeing very strong demand this year, driven by demand for generative AI. We are working closely with our customers and have begun sampling our industry-leading HBM3 product offering.

The customer response has been strong, and we believe our HBM3 product delivers significantly higher bandwidth than competing solutions and establishes the new benchmark in performance and consumption supported by our 1 beta technology, TSV and other innovations, enabling a differentiated advanced packaging solution.

We expect to begin a mass production ramp for this exciting HBM3 product in early calendar 2024 and to achieve meaningful revenues in fiscal 2024. Micron also has a strong position in the industry transition to D5, which is the latest generation of DDR memory. Our D5 percentage of DRAM shipments has more than doubled from fiscal Q2 to Q3 and we expect Micron D5 volume to cross over D4 at the end of first calendar quarter of 2024 versus mid-calendar 2024 for the industry.

Micron's 1 alpha D5 modules are qualified and shipping to data center customers. We are also making good progress on our 1 beta-based high-density 128 gigabyte D5 modules using a 32 gigabit die that optimizes cost and performance to provide customers with a lower cost of ownership solution for memory-intensive workloads like AI. We expect these high-density modules to ramp in calendar Q2 of 2024 and with significant cost improvements over today's expense sales, TSV-based solutions in the industry.

Our 96-gigabyte D5 high-density module built on 1 alpha technology using 24 gigabit die is already shipping in volume and delivers equivalent performance for the majority of workloads versus the more expensive TSV, dual die package-based 128-gigabyte modules.

In data center SSDs, Micron's entire portfolio is now on 176 layer or 232 layer NAND, demonstrating our product and technology leadership. We are in a strong position to serve AI demand for fast storage as these data-intensive applications proliferate. In fiscal Q3, we launched the world's first 200-plus layer NAND data center SSD, and qualification is in progress at multiple key customers to support AI cluster installations. In fact, we have already passed qualification of this product at a critical server OEM partner. We also launched our Extreme endurance data center SSD, which offers superior scalability and affordability versus hard drives.

In PCs, we now forecast calendar 2023 PC unit volume to decline by a low double-digit percentage year-over-year with PC units expected to be below the pre-COVID levels last seen in 2019. We are excited about the ongoing industry transition to D5 and are well positioned for it with our strong D5 product lineup. Industry clients D5 mix is expected to cross over from D4 in early calendar 2024.

In fiscal Q3, we achieved record quarterly client SSD bit shipments driven by share growth in client SSDs as customers adopted our industry-leading solutions. Our SSD QLC bit shipment mix reached a new record for the third consecutive quarter with growth in both clients and consumer.

Last month, we launched crucial T700, the world's fastest Gen 5 PCIe consumer SSD built with our 232 layer NAND. In graphics, industry analysts continue to expect graphics TAM growth CAGR to outpace the broader market supported by applications across client and data center. We expect customer inventories to normalize in calendar Q3. We plan to introduce our next-generation G7 product on our industry-leading 1-beta node in the first half of calendar year 2024.

In mobile, we now expect calendar 2023 smartphone unit volumes to be down by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year. While units are weaker, we are seeing stronger memory content growth driven by a mix shift toward premium phones and elasticity. We expect sequential growth in fiscal Q4 as customers prepare for upcoming product launches in the back half of calendar 2023.

In fiscal Q3, we achieved key mobile customer qualifications on our 1 beta base LP5X and started high-volume revenue shipments to Tier 1 OEMs. In addition, we achieved significant milestones in UFS with the qualification and ramp of a high-capacity UMCP5 featuring 16 gigabyte of DRAM and 512 gigabytes of NAND. We have also started to sample a new UFS4 product based on our latest 232-layer NAND technology, which enables industry-leading performance for flagship handsets.

Last, I'll cover the auto and industrial end markets, which represent over 20% of our revenue and contribute more stable revenue and profitability. Micron continues to lead in automotive, which is a key market and growth driver for us. In fiscal Q3, auto revenue reached another quarterly record and grew by a high single-digit percentage year-over-year. We continue to expect growth in auto memory demand for the second half of calendar 2023, driven by easing non-memory semiconductor supply, normalizing customer inventory levels and increasing memory content per vehicle.

The industrial market saw early signs of recovery in fiscal Q3. Inventory levels are stabilizing at distribution partners and at the majority of our customers. As a result, we expect an improvement in demand in the second half of calendar 2023. We are excited about our growth prospects in this market as industrial customers continue to adopt and implement IoT, AI and machine learning in the factory.

Now turning to industry outlook. Our expectations for calendar 2023 industry bit demand growth has been further reduced to low to mid-single digits in DRAM and to high single digits in NAND, which are well below the expected long-term CAGR of mid-teens percentage range in DRAM and low 20s percentage range in NAND. While the AI-driven demand has been stronger than our expectations 3 months ago, the PC, smartphone and traditional server demand forecasts are now lower.

We continue to expect stronger industry bit shipments for DRAM and NAND in the second half of the calendar year, driven by secular content growth and continued improvement in customer inventory. While the industry demand forecast for calendar 2023 is now lower, the significant supply reductions across the industry have started to stabilize the market.

We see both DRAM and NAND year-over-year supply growth to be negative for the industry in calendar 2023, as utilization and CapEx cuts across the industry impact supply growth. While supply/demand balance is improving due to the excess inventory, profitability and cash flow will remain extremely challenged for some time. Market recovery can accelerate if there is further reduction in industry production and these cuts are sustained well into calendar 2024.

In response to the industry environment, Micron has taken decisive actions to bring our supply back in balance with demand. We expect Micron's year-on-year bit supply growth to be meaningfully negative for DRAM. We also expect to produce fewer NAND bits in calendar 2023 than in calendar 2022.

Our fiscal 2023 CapEx plan of $7 billion is down more than 40% from last year, with WFE down more than 50%. We continue to expect fiscal '24 WFE to be down year-on-year. Recently, we have further reduced wafer starts to approach 30% in both DRAM and NAND. We currently expect reduced wafer starts will continue well into calendar 2024, and as we remain focused on managing down our inventories and controlling our supply.

I will now turn it over to Mark.

**Mark Murphy**

Thanks, Sanjay. Good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal Q3 results were in line to better than expectations, with revenue coming in above the midpoint of our guidance range and gross margin and EPS exceeding the high end of the range.

Total fiscal Q3 revenue was approximately $3.8 billion, up 2% sequentially and down 57% year-over-year. Fiscal Q3 revenue included $72 million from an insurance settlement disclosed at the time we provided guidance. Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was $2.7 billion representing 71% of total revenue. DRAM revenue declined 2% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing in the 10 percentage range and prices declining by approximately 10%.

Fiscal Q3 NAND revenue was $1 billion, representing 27% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue increased 14% sequentially with bit shipments increasing in the upper 30 percentage range and prices declining in the mid-teens percentage range.

Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking business unit revenue was $1.4 billion, up 1% sequentially. Strong sequential growth in server and graphics revenues was offset by a decline in client. Embedded business unit revenue was $912 million, up 5% sequentially. On a sequential basis, automotive and consumer revenues were strong.

Revenue for the mobile business unit was $819 million, down 13% sequentially due to timing of shipments. As Sanjay mentioned, we expect growth in mobile revenues in fiscal Q4. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $627 million, up 24% sequentially and driven by increased shipments across most of the portfolio.

The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q3 was negative 16%, improving 15 percentage points sequentially. This result was negatively impacted by approximately $400 million or 11 percentage points of write-downs associated with inventory produced in the quarter.

Operating expenses in fiscal Q3 were $866 million, down roughly $50 million sequentially. OpEx benefited from ongoing expense reduction initiatives and gains on sales of certain assets. We had an operating loss of roughly $1.5 billion in fiscal Q3 resulting in an operating margin of negative 39%, improved from negative 56% in the prior quarter.

Fiscal Q3 taxes were $102 million, higher than expectations at the time of our guidance driven by onetime discrete items. As mentioned in previous quarters, despite a consolidated loss on a worldwide basis, we still have taxes payable in certain geographies due to taxable income levels reported in those geographies.

The non-GAAP loss per share in fiscal Q3 was $1.43, down from a loss per share of $1.91 in the prior quarter, and earnings per share of $2.59 in the prior year. Fiscal Q3 EPS included approximately $0.37 of losses from the impact of the inventory write-down associated with inventory produced in the quarter.

Turning to cash flows and capital spending. Our operating cash flows were approximately $24 million. Capital expenditures were $1.4 billion during the quarter. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $7 billion for the fiscal year. that's near $1 billion in fiscal Q4.

Free cash flow was negative $1.4 billion in the quarter and improved from the previous 2 quarters. Our fiscal Q3 ending inventory was $8.2 billion or 168 days. Due to increases in process steps and product complexity, we now target inventory levels of around 120 days, which at present would equate to approximately $6 billion. Our current inventories include strategic stocks of approximately $1 billion over target levels associated with build-ahead of product for cost optimization and risk mitigation.

At quarter end, we held cash and investments of $11.4 billion and had total liquidity of $13.9 billion, including our untapped credit facility. We issued $1.5 billion of long-term debt in the quarter. And with part of those proceeds paid down $600 million of our term loan facility resulting in a net increase to debt of $900 million. Our fiscal Q3 ending debt was $13.2 billion.

Now turning to our outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter. As mentioned in filings and our comments today, the CAC decision is a headwind to our outlook. We expect the revenue impact to vary by quarter with the impact in fiscal Q4 being less than the quarterly impact in the first half of fiscal 2024. Over time, we have a goal of retaining our global market share in both DRAM and NAND.

In fiscal Q4, as the industry demand continues to improve and despite the effects on our business from the CAC decision, we still see record bit shipments. Fiscal Q4 gross margin will be impacted by costs from underutilization, weak pricing levels and product mix. In the current business environment, the gap between our DRAM and NAND profitability is significant, and changes in the mix can drive large variability in gross margins.

Our gross margin guidance does not contemplate additional write-downs of inventory. We continue to aggressively manage our operating expenses and remain on track to exit the fiscal year at less than $850 million.

Looking beyond fiscal Q4, we expect OpEx to increase over $50 million in fiscal Q1 2024 on R&D program expense timing. And as reductions to employee compensation end. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q4 is as follows: we expect revenue to be $3.9 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of negative 10.5% plus or minus 250 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $845 million plus or minus $15 million; we expect tax expenses of approximately $40 million.

Based on a share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares, we expect EPS to be a loss of $1.19 plus or minus $0.07.

In closing, we continue to act quickly and tenaciously to navigate this downturn, making the investments to maintain our leading capabilities across technology, products and manufacturing while preserving our solid balance sheet. In this environment, we remain sharply focused on improving our profitability and free cash flow.

As market conditions improve, we will continue to drive efficiencies to hold on to productivity gains. Despite the impact of this downturn and effects of the CAC decision, we remain confident in our financial model and our ability to deliver long-term profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns.

I will now turn it back over to Sanjay.

**Sanjay Mehrotra**

Thank you, Mark. I'm proud of the execution of the Micron team and the progress we've made this quarter. The leadership products we released and qualified [are] strengthening Micron's portfolio across multiple key markets. While there are near-term headwinds, I'm excited about the new product introductions that we have planned for the next several quarters, which will further enable us to leverage the dramatic growth in AI that is ahead of us.

I'm confident that this portfolio momentum, combined with our technology capability, manufacturing excellence, financial discipline and excellent customer relationships will position us well for the future.

I also want to call attention to Micron's 2023 Sustainability Report, which published yesterday. The report underscores our continued commitment to innovation the environment, our people and the communities where we operate, outlining our progress and escalations across our environmental, social and governance programs. I encourage you to review the full report on Micron's website.

Thank you for joining us today. We will now open for questions.

**Operator**

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI.

**Christopher Muse**

I guess first question, with inventory expected to normalize in the coming months quarter, how are you seeing customer purchasing behavior perhaps change given that we're clearly hitting a pricing trough very soon. We'd love to hear kind of how those discussions might be changing.

**Sanjay Mehrotra**

Thanks, CJ, for that question. We, of course, continue to work closely with our customers. And as we said, that customer inventories are improving, except for data center, inventories are close to normal in most of our other end markets. Data center we said by end of this year or somewhat thereafter -- shortly thereafter, data center customer inventories, we expect to improve as well.

And we continue to work closely with our customers. Some of the customers definitely interested in some of the longer-term outlook for the business and other customers operate on a month-to-month basis. And overall, of course, we continue to mitigate through some of the impact of the China decision as well. But the value that we are bringing to the customers for our products continues to strengthen, and Micron is very much focused on navigating through the current downturn and working closely with our customers to address their future demand.

And as we have said in my remarks that some of the customers, given the low pricing that exists in the industry today, and before prices begin to increase substantially, some of the customers may be looking at purchasing additional volumes at this time. But in general, the trajectory is of continuing improvement in their inventory levels end to end across the supply chain, add the customers directly as well as third parties who may be supplying to the customers. And as you know, inventories at the suppliers are coming down as well.

**Christopher Muse**

Very helpful. If I could just follow up real quickly on HBM3. You guided to meaningful [reps], in fiscal '24. Can you give us a sense of what that means? And over time, what size kind of could that look like for you guys looking out kind of 3, 5 years?

**Sanjay Mehrotra**

Well, with respect to HBM3, we are very excited about this product. Micron has focused on bringing an industry-leading product and HBM3 product that is in early stages of sampling. And we expect to begin production volume ramp of this product in early 2024 is a product that has significantly higher performance, bandwidth and significantly lower power. In fact, as a product, it is close to a generational leap ahead of anything else that is in the market.

We have received strong endorsement for this product in the market, and we expect the volume ramp of this product for us to be rapid, to be steep ramp, and this will bring in our fiscal year 2024 strong revenue growth opportunity for us. So we are very excited about this standout product. It will be a significant growth driver for Micron. And everything that we have done here is, of course, built on our industry-leading 1-beta technology and applying to it, of course, advanced packaging, differentiated packaging and TSV capability.

So this is, we believe, going to be a standout product for us. And we expect we target a share with HBM with this kind of an industry-leading product that would be higher than our average DRAM share in the industry as well.

**Operator**

And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.

**Timothy Arcuri**

I had 2. Mark, the first one is for you. I was wondering if you can sort of lay out what the fiscal Q4 guidance would have looked like in net of the ban. I know you said that the impact from the ban gets worse actually in the fiscal first half. So is it as simple as maybe fiscal Q4, you had said low double-digit did impact, but it sounds like it's probably not that big in fiscal Q4. So something less than that in fiscal Q4, and then you sort of expand to a number or something in that range in the first half of fiscal 2025 or '24 rather, can you sort of handicap that for us and shape it for us.

**Mark Murphy**

Yes. We had a small impact in very small in Q3. It's a more material impact in Q4. We do expect the impact to increase. However, our actions to mitigate that will help offset the effect. But really, at this time, it's a headwind, but there's -- and that's clear. However, we are taking mitigating actions and it's very uncertain continues to evolve on what the impact will be. And again, the impact that we see in the fourth quarter, it's contemplated in our guidance.

**Timothy Arcuri**

Got it. Maybe I'll ask you in the follow-up. But my second question is for Sanjay. So Sanjay, I asked you this last call, too. So you alluded to the smartphone customers at least wanting to kind of get out in front of what they see maybe could be some tightness and maybe they're opportunistically trying to take advantage of pricing being so low. Can you just talk more broadly about what might change in your relationship with your customers coming out of this downturn? I mean, could we be headed toward a situation where maybe the data center customers that pushed you and your peers so far during the downturn that maybe we can talk about LTAs at some point. I know that this is a ways away, given kind of where we are today. But can you just talk about maybe over the past 3 months, when I asked you last time how the tone of the discussion with the data center customers in particular has changed.

**Sanjay Mehrotra**

Well, our customers, of course, work with us on LTAs. And as we have said, LTAs relate to their forecast for the year, generally. And while some customers may be operating on shorter term or other customers longer term. But generally speaking, they operate on yearly LTAs and LTAs involve supply and demand commitments from the 2 sides. Of course, sometimes with the changing industry environment on either side, on the supply or on the demand side, there can be adjustments made to those LTAs, and we work closely with our customers in those regards.

And we have had close relationships with the customers. We have a very strong product momentum. You are particularly inquiring about data center. And let me tell you that our product momentum in data center with strong portfolio of solutions, particularly addressing the growing interest in AI, in data center, generative AI, becoming a big opportunity, and we look at it for 2024 as a big year for AI and for memory and storage and Micron will be well positioned with this product. And these are all parts of our discussions when we address their requirements on their future purchases when we address LTA requirements. And of course, we need the necessary investments related to our production mix in terms of die requirements, in terms of our assembly and test requirements and we really work closely with our customers to help manage these.

And just keep in mind that, as I mentioned, that a lot of new product considerations go into the LTAs as well. As well as, of course, the volume and overall demand and supply considerations. So LTAs at the end, really help both the parties. They help us plan our engineering, our product road map, alignment on that, our investments in things such as back-end capacity because products like HBM, product like high-density modules and of course, in the mobile sector, products like MCPs, et cetera, have all different considerations at the back end. And these are the kind of things, the LTAs really help us plan with our customers.

**Operator**

And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen.

**Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan**

Congrats on the good results. Sanjay, the first question I wanted to ask you was you spoke about AI servers having 6x to 8x more DRAM content and that demand is strong while traditional data center service demand is weak. There's a view that some of these AI servers are replacing over 10 of the DCs, regular DC servers. So I'm just kind of curious how to think about overall DRAM demand as AI grows but probably cannibalizes some of your regular data center server DRAM content. And then I have a follow-up.

**Sanjay Mehrotra**

So look, when we look at the overall DRAM demand, the DRAM TAM, of course, the AI is driving growth. Automotive, certainly driving growth. Other end markets, such as we mentioned, mobile and PC in terms of all consumer, in terms of their end demand, has been somewhat lackluster. The AI demand that is driven in data center, whether it is in the enterprise definitely drives healthy trends for memory growth. Yes, enterprise server and some of the data center demand has been recently somewhat impacted by the macro trends, but the trend of AI and more memory is absolutely continuing. And that's what -- when we look at our overall 2023 demand growth and the projections of CAGR that we have ahead of us, we have taken those into account.

This is very, very early innings for AI, and AI is really pervasive. It's everywhere in, of course, cloud applications, enterprise server applications, applications such as generative AI would be in enterprises too because due to confidentiality of data, enterprises will be building their own large language models. And as you know, while the enterprise large language models, may not be as large as the large language models you may see in examples such as super clusters, et cetera. But all of them are really trending towards greater number of parameters.

Now we are talking about parameters with Generative AI getting into even trillion parameter range, not too long ago. These used to be in 100 millions of range. That requires more memory. So regardless of the applications, whether it is on the enterprise side or on the cloud server side, the memory requirements are continuing to increase. And I'll just point out that 6x to 8x that we have mentioned is the multiple of DRAM requirement in AI server versus standard server. And of course, as we highlighted in the script, there are many compute configurations, such as the super cluster example that we gave you, where the DRAM content that is required is few hundred times higher than a standard server.

So really, I think the journey here ahead of us will be very exciting. And when we look at machine-to-machine communication, when we look at opportunities for the virtuous cycle for the ever-increasing data that training applications, that inferencing at scale and various edge applications including automotive are driving the requirements for memory and storage will continue to grow well, and Micron is going to be well positioned with our products.

And we consider 2024 to be a big banner year for AI, for memory and storage. And Micron will be well positioned to capture this with our strong portfolio of products from D5 to LP5 to HBM to high-density modules even including graphics.

**Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan**

Got it. Got it. Very helpful, Sanjay. And then a follow-up for Mark. You said no inventory write-down in the current quarter expected. And if I remember right, Mark, you also mentioned in the past that inventory write-down [indiscernible] your view on pricing 3 quarters out. So is it fair to assume that you're expecting a pricing drop pretty much in this quarter? And is the CAC decision does get really worse that 15% to 25% of your sales gets impacted, is there any more risk of inventory write-down? Or is that agnostic inventory write down?

**Mark Murphy**

Yes. Thanks, Krish. Maybe spend a few minutes just covering because of a very complicated topic with a lot of moving parts. Maybe spend a bit of time on the topic. So our reported gross margin, our outlook, it's a function of many factors, including pricing. The inventory write-downs, which do include or incorporate our forward view of pricing. The effects of utilization, which you heard today, we've increased or reduced our wafer starts further. And then just volumes and associated leverage on [period] costs as discussed in previous quarters, and of course, mix. These factors are continuously changing due to market environment and our actions, and as I've stated before at these lower levels of profitability, our margin forecast and results are more sensitive to slight changes in assumptions such as price.

Now given price trends and our current view on pricing and costs, we took a material write-down in the second quarter as we reported $1.4 billion, took another $400 million this quarter. And with these write-downs, we've pulled forward inventory costs, hence lowered the carrying value of on-hand inventories.

Yes, as a lower cost inventory clears in the future quarters, we realized more income in those quarters than we would have otherwise without the charge. So as an example, we took this $400 million of additional write-downs in third quarter for inventories produced. And considering our latest views on volume mix, we also realized a benefit of near $300 million from selling through the lower cost inventories impacted by the second quarter write-down.

So I do want to call out that it's -- with all the uncertainty, complexity and sensitivity at these profitability levels, our write-down and the benefits that we had in the third quarter, we're not far off what we estimated in our guide. So I think that's a good reflection of our handle of what's happening in the business.

Now we've also got underutilization effects, which are creating higher costs and inventories and adding period costs. We project roughly $1.1 billion of underutilization impact in FY '23 associated with the front end. Most of that will impact the P&L this year. Some of it will carry over to next year. But because of the effect of the write-down accounting, less of it will carry over to next year than would have otherwise.

Beyond this period of write-down effects, the impact of lower wafer starts between the period cost and the higher cost inventories, the effect is higher single digits on margins then down to mid- and lower single digits on margins as revenues increase.

So considering all this, just to give you a sense of profile of margin and in turn, pricing to your question. We said last quarter that we expect -- or as we said last quarter, we expect -- we had a reported second quarter margin to be the trough, and that was driven by the $1.4 billion write-down.

With a much lower inventory charge forecasted in the third quarter, which happened, that margin improved about 15 points. And then also, as mentioned last quarter, we said that fourth quarter would be better than third quarter on a lower write-down. And hence, we guided today 5 points better than the third quarter. Again, these estimates are sensitive to pricing changes. And -- but in our current view, we expect a gradual improvement on margin to continue sequentially on a reported basis.

Now if you take our non-GAAP third quarter gross margin of negative 16%, and we were to strip out the write-down effects in third quarter, both the write-down portion and the realized benefit. And also to normalize, you strip out the insurance settlement, which we had in the third quarter, we would still be -- those 2 things largely offset. So we'd be still at about 16% negative gross margin.

So again, over 100 net inventory effects, the $400 million write down less the $300 million realized benefit and then the roughly the same over 100 insurance settlement. So -- and this is a function of the pricing environment, which we, I think, properly captured in our guide.

Now that adjusted 16 -- or that adjusted margin, 16% is down clearly versus the adjusted second quarter margin, which, as I recall, is about 7%, so down 23 points. So under this adjusted view, we would trough on gross margin over the next few quarters, and then we would improve off these low levels through FY '24. So this is a profile that's consistent with what we've discussed before, though the levels are a bit lower and a bit delayed. And so hopefully, that provide you some color both on how we see pricing and how we see gross margin playing out with all the puts and takes.

**Operator**

And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.

**Harlan Sur**

I guess as a follow-up to that, Mark, on your gross margin guidance for the fourth quarter. I know there are no inventory write-downs, but is it contemplating a step-up in underutilization charges or period costs associated with underutilization charges sequentially? And because you cut your wafer starts another 5 percentage points right to 30% and if you could maybe quantify that step-up in underutilization charges? And then as a follow-up, is the incremental 5% cut in utilization is primarily a result of the CAC restrictions?

**Mark Murphy**

It is not. It's more of an industry dynamic and our intent to get supply discipline in the market. Supply needs to come out of the market given inventory levels, and that's the principal driver. As far as the effects of utilization, it is already incorporated in this guide. The period costs in the fourth quarter are about $200 million. And again, they're contemplated in the guidance.

**Operator**

And our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets.

**Ambrish Srivastava**

I want to come back to the gross margin. When you had given the guidance for this quarter, you were -- you had walked us through in detail. And you had said that stripping out all the adjustments and the industry write-down, 3Q would be at 7.5%. Am I reading this right that now you stripped out as negative 16%, right? So it's much worse than what you were thinking?

**Mark Murphy**

No, I don't think it's much worse than what you're thinking. If you strip out just the underutilization effects, but you keep in the insurance settlement, you're close to what we said, sort of that 7%, 8%. So that you need to consider. We had said that was in there.

**Ambrish Srivastava**

Okay. Got it. And then a follow-up, either for you or for Sanjay. On the 15% round number, 15% of bit loss, share loss in China. How do you recoup that? Is that based on the assumption that bit growth or bit supply will be constrained? And so if the other 2 suppliers are able to meet the China demand, they'll leave some demand out here in other regions for you to basically go after? or Is there a pricing element to that? I'm just not make sure I understand how you get that.

**Sanjay Mehrotra**

I will take that. So what we have said is that approximately 50% of our business in China is at risk of getting impacted. And of course, we are focused on mitigating any share loss with CIIOs or as a result of CAC decision, with those customers -- global customers who are not impacted by CAC decision. So keep in mind that our share in DRAM is approximately 23% and our share in NAND is approximately 12%. So obviously, we have opportunities to gain share with other customers. And this is what we are focused on. It will take some time, and the CAC decision can -- I mean, as we have said, it is hurting our business. It is slowing our recovery. It can result in quarter-to-quarter variations as well. But over longer term, our target is to maintain our share.

So while near term, CAC decision is challenging. Longer term, we will work with customers who are not impacted. Our global customers who are not impacted by CAC decision to increase our share. And we have a long history of working with our customers. We have brought tremendous value of our innovation, our supply, our product portfolio supporting their innovation and road maps in the marketplace. Our customers want to see a strong Micron. Our strategy of keeping our target share consistent over longer term with our current share is understood by our customers because, again, they want to see a strong Micron. So they are supportive of this. And we will continue to work with our customers.

And of course, as we bring value to our customers with our products and our product portfolio, we will focus on ROI on our investments, and we'll certainly focus on improving the profitability of our business from current levels as well. So we will, of course, keep profitability in mind. And again, it's important that Micron is a strong partner to our customers. And I think customers understand that multiple strong players in the industry is a benefit for multiple reasons to our customer ecosystem.

**Operator**

And our final question for today comes from the line of Tom O'Malley from Barclays.

**Thomas O'Malley**

Recently, we've been picking up that there is a change in some of the A series where you're starting to see some HBM2E ease just given the fact that there's limited capacity of HBM3. I guess part 1 is, are you seeing an ability to service that market today? And then the second part of the question is you're saying that AI servers see about 6 to 8x DRAM content I assume that contemplates the HBM, but you guys are talking about some AI tailwinds today when you're really not servicing that market as much. So could you talk about what you're seeing ex-HBM as the multiplier effect on DRAM today, just so we can get a picture of how you guys are seeing the improvement in data center what they have today ex that product. That would be really helpful.

**Sanjay Mehrotra**

So certainly, we have had HBM2E product in the marketplace that actually gave us strong experience in bringing up our technology and production capability with HBM. The market, as I mentioned, is -- has shifted is shifting to HBM3 and Micron's HBM3+ product, which I called as a generational leap ahead of anything in the industry is going to position us well as we bring that into volume production during the course of our fiscal year '24, starting early part of calendar '24, contributing to several hundred million dollars of revenue opportunity over time.

And with respect to AI part of the market, I want to be very clear that, yes, with respect to high-density modules and with respect to high bandwidth, HBM3 solutions. That part of the market is growing this year, and it's an opportunity that we want to capture, and I believe that we'll be well positioned to capture, as I mentioned, that we will be targeting share in HBM with our absolute industry-leading product that's higher than our DRAM industry average share.

So -- but it's important to understand is that AI is being served not only by HBM or high-density DRAM modules, but it is also being served by D5 memory and by LP DRAM as well. And this is where with the D5 and LP DRAM products, we gave you some examples in our script as well, a large amount of LP DRAM being used in industry-leading high-performance compute platforms.

In fact, the 144 terabytes that we mentioned in DGX, GH 200, about 122 terabytes of that is LP DRAM. And Micron is very well positioned with a differentiated solution of our LP DRAM out there today. So I think it's important to understand that the AI server market is made up of HBM. It's made up of high-density DRAM modules includes -- it also is made up of DDR5, LP5 and some element of [graphics] memory as well.

So we do have a broad portfolio. And in 2024 with HBM and high-density DRAM modules getting into production, I really believe we'll be extremely well positioned to capture the growing opportunity in AI. And 75% of DRAM on AI servers today is DDDR5. And as I emphasized, and as I'm sure you well know, we participate very well in D5. In fact, we led the industry with our D5 products, again, built on 1-beta technology here.

This does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's program. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

**Operator**

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Micron's Post-Earnings Analyst Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Farhan Ahmad, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

**Farhan Ahmad**

Thank you, and welcome to Micron Technology's fiscal third quarter 2023 sell-side analyst call back. On the call with today are Sumit Sadana, Micron's Chief Business Officer; Manish Bhatia, our EVP of Global Operations; and Mark Murphy, our CFO.

As a reminder, the matters we are discussing today include forward-looking statements regarding market demand and supply, our expected results and other matters. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made today. We refer you to the documents we filed with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of the risks that may affect our future results.

Jonathan, we can now open the Q&A.

**Operator**

And our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.

**Toshiya Hari**

Can you hear me okay?

**Mark Murphy**

Yes, we can hear you.

**Farhan Ahmad**

Yes, Toshiya.

**Toshiya Hari**

Okay. Great. Mark, maybe on the CAC dynamic. I know there was a question on the main call as to what's assumed in the current quarter. I thought I'd give another shot. What is assumed in terms of potential headwinds from the CAC ruling in China? And I guess on the CAC dynamic, just at a very fundamental level, what's driving the uncertainty with regards to how customers respond. Is it the guideline itself that's uncertain, therefore, like your customers are confused and perplexed as well? Or do the customers know what they need to do, but they're just not telling you? Just curious what's driving the uncertainty.

**Mark Murphy**

Yes. So it's a sensitive matter. So we're not going to talk a lot about it. We're trying to be -- talk to what we know and understand. But the situation is still evolving. There is uncertainty associated with it, and it is challenging.

So we have outlined our -- what we view is our exposure, and we view our principal exposure as China-headquartered companies, which we've identified as direct sales to China-headquartered companies or sales of distributors into China-headquartered companies. And that total China exposure, which is the principal exposure is 25%.

Now we see the risk associated with our business, which we've sized is about half of that. So that's the potential risk that we see at this time. Now we had very little effect in the third quarter. We expect -- well, we see more of an effect, a more material effect in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, but then we anticipate that working with customers and share redistribution and other things may mitigate the impact.

So we've not -- we have a number in our guide, of course, and you can assume that it's not the full amount of the exposure at this time. But I think that's -- hopefully provides you some boundary conditions for the exposure.

**Toshiya Hari**

Got it. And then as a quick follow-up, another one for you, Mark. Just on cash flow, I think on the call, you guys talked about cash flow likely to -- is likely to remain challenged or extremely challenged for some time. You're sort of calling the bottom on the cycle. Given the supply side cuts, I think working capital hopefully starts to become more positive as opposed to being negative over the coming quarters. So net-net, how should we think about free cash flow potentially returning to positive territory, obviously, not in the near term, but perhaps sometime in fiscal '24, how should we think about the pluses and minuses? And if you can talk to potential government subsidies, whether that be in the U.S. or elsewhere, that would be helpful as well.

**Mark Murphy**

Sure. I'll talk about -- to your point, I'll talk a bit about CapEx also. But the speed and the depth of the decline we've had in the business, combined with the node investment cycle that we had early in the downturn resulted in substantial cash flow use, and we saw that in the first quarter, the second quarter and the third quarter with peak use in the second quarter of $1.8 billion. And as we reported, we were at $1.4 billion this third of negative free cash flow.

But the market conditions, they remain weak, and we have high fixed costs. So we are trying to remain operating cash flow positive through this period of weakness, and we were able to do that in the third quarter.

At these low levels of operating cash flow, though we've reduced CapEx considerably, we expect to be negative free cash flow into and through a good part, if not all, of FY '24, just depends on how the market recovery proceeds and how comfortable we are in the profile of CapEx spend.

Now we're always circumspect on capital spending, but we're going to obviously keep it -- keep spending low until we see clear signs of recovery. We've already pulled WFE down 50% year-over-year. Next year, WFE will be lower than this year. It's noteworthy that in the fourth quarter, our WFE is only going to be 20% of the spend. So I mean we've really cut down spending on tools.

We are projecting the market to find its footing and improvements to materialize from here and lead TO operating cash flow growth in the second half of FY '24. And as long as we see that coming together, it's reasonable to assume that CapEx levels may be around this year's levels with more of a construction mix than this year and also more back half-weighted given that we want to make sure that the market is recovering before we spend.

As mentioned on the call, that would include an increase in HBM spend versus prior plans. And again, the rate and pace of recovery will be in large part driven by, yes, the industry's supply response. So we're being very sensitive about any incremental bit capacity, and there's just some strong actions on the supply side are still needed to -- given where inventories are.

**Operator**

And our next question comes from the line Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.

**Aaron Rakers**

Mark, I got two questions. I want to start with the gross margin, and I apologize for trying to unpack this a little bit further. But as we kind of think about the fact that the inventory charges are now kind of abating, I guess the question is, is that relative to the $300 million positive effect of kind of the sell-through of previously written down inventory?

Would you not expect that to potentially trend materially higher over these next couple of quarters? And also in that gross margin, how are we thinking specifically around the wafer reduction underutilization costs?

I think you talked about $200 million in fiscal 4Q embedded in the guide. I think in the prior filings, I think in total, there's around $300 million for the full year. Is that still the case? Just trying to think about those 2 variables in particular. Then I got one other question.

**Mark Murphy**

Yes. So there -- let me get started, and you can kind of ask questions along the way because it's a very complicated topic and I want to make sure that we're answering your questions.

On the first one, I think your question was around we realized the benefit of lower cost inventories in the third quarter just under $300 million close to what we had expected. And I think your question was how does that look in the next several quarters, and it does increase. We expect about a $500 million benefit in the fourth quarter, then we expect about $500 million in the following 2 quarters. So that's the benefit on that lower cost inventories that sort of as it clears the next several quarters.

On your question of the underutilization charges, you have 2 components of that. You have the amount that's in inventories and you have period costs. Interestingly, most of the write-down in the third quarter was related to that underutilization-related costs and inventories. And so that's what makes this complicated on a go-forward basis because you've got a lot of those underutilization costs and inventories get pulled forward to these charges. So that's happened.

You have the period costs left behind and as I mentioned on the call, you've got about $200 million of period costs in fourth quarter. You've got another $200 million-ish in the first quarter. And then some of those period costs start to trail off. But I did mention that the underutilization charges -- so the higher cost inventories associated with underutilization charges, they do persist through FY '24 and, obviously, the effect on margin is a function of the revenue. But I said the effect is kind of from high-single digit down to mid-single digit through the year on a percent.

**Aaron Rakers**

That's perfect. My other quick question was just you talked about $6 billion as kind of the normalized inventory level. You're at $8.2 billion. But then you also said that you're carrying about $1 billion or so strategic inventory reserve. When does the latter start to burn off? How do we think about what normalized looks like? Do we think $6 billion is the right number? Or do we say, "Hey, when you get to $7 billion, you're going to continue to carry kind of $1 billion of strategic inventory?"

**Mark Murphy**

No. I mean there are specific reasons for carrying some of that $1 billion. So I think the way to look at it is we're aspiring to get down to this kind of 120 days. I think that's the way to view it. And we provided that number. Let's not -- we're certainly not trying to say that, that $1 billion is the reason our inventory levels are too much. I mean the majority of our -- of this "excess" so to speak or higher inventories that we want, it's not that.

And so we're absolutely focused on and serious on our supply response to get our inventory levels down. But we did want to make it clear that we have a new target. That new target is 120 days, and that's up from what we had before of 110, and that's just due to additional process steps in the new technology for complex products.

So 120 days is the new target. We do have some strategic intentional builds that adds on top of that at this point, call it, 20 days or so. And so call it, 130, 140 days is kind of where we are in the near term, aspiring to get down by near term, near to medium term, trying to work down to that level probably by the end of '24. And again, it's -- that leaves a considerable amount of inventories to work down to get to that level.

One thing I just wanted to clean up here, it came up on the call, and I don't know if Ambrish is going to ask the question, but he asked a question about the third quarter. We said that it would be negative 7.5%. I went back and checked the transcript. And just to be clear, we did say that. But we said if you were just to strip out the impairment charges, so really, it was just the write-down charge. And if you do that -- which is $400 million in our third quarter that we reported. So if you do that, you have a margin of negative 5.4%. So we actually did better than what we said we would do on the call.

Now if we adjust for the credit, then the margin is 13% roughly. And -- but I just wanted to mention that since it came up on the call.

**Operator**

And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley.

**Joseph Moore**

In Sanjay's upfront remarks, he talked about the GH200 from NVIDIA and kind of a partnership doing low-power memory for that product. Can you talk a little bit about that? And kind of just generally, when you talk about having a role for low-power DRAM in these kind of bigger AI clusters, what role is that? And what is Micron doing to enable that?

**Sumit Sadana**

So -- this is Sumit. So I'll just give you a quick overview on that. So we have a special partnership in which this product has been developed for LPDRAM to be adapted to the data center. Typically, LPDRAM has not been used in the data center for a number of reasons, including the fact that it doesn't have the vast capabilities, the reliability, availability and serviceability capabilities that data center customers have relied on, on DDR5 and DDR4 products in the past. So there is work to be done to adapt this technology.

And then there is some additional features and functionality that are important to deploy that we have worked on to create a differentiated product here that is unique in the industry. It's not a standard LPDRAM product.

And so this product has been developed in partnership with NVIDIA, and it's a unique and differentiated product and the overwhelming majority of the 144 terabytes of DRAM is this unique differentiated product that we have codeveloped and will be deployed in volume production. So we're really excited about it.

I mean this does significantly reduce power consumption because power consumption is a big challenge in the data center. And bringing low-power DRAM to the data center through products like this one is a big step forward, and we are really excited to be leading the industry on that front.

**Joseph Moore**

Great. And then for a follow-up, also on the AI topic. You talked a lot about HBM3, but it seems like there's also a pretty healthy market for 128 gig modules for the main memory. Can you talk about where Micron is in terms of getting qualified for that product?

**Sumit Sadana**

Sure, yes. So yes, there is -- if you look at the whole spectrum of high capacity memory modules, it's really 96 gigabyte, 128 gigabyte, 256 gigabyte. And the overwhelming majority of the high-capacity module volume is on the 128-gigabyte SKU. Very little on the 256 and the 96-gigabyte SKU is relatively new.

We do have a 96-gigabyte product in the high-capacity module offering right now. It has been in volume production since the late part of FQ3, and it will continue to ramp through FQ4. And the rest of fiscal '24, we expect to sell that in increasing volumes.

It's -- the 96-gigabyte module actually has performance characteristics that are indistinguishable from the 128-gigabyte module at significantly lower cost per bit because our implementation of the 96-gigabyte module is through a monolithic 24-gigabit die rather than using TSV. And so its cost structure is very, very good, much lower than the higher cost implementation using TSV.

We are taking a very similar approach to doing 128-gigabyte modules. We are going to be doing that using a single -- in a monolithic 32-gigabit die in our 1-beta technology for DRAM. And once again, we'll be able to do that without using TSV technology.

Of course, we'll use TSV technology for things like HBM. And we spoke about that at length in the last call. But the 128-gigabyte module that we make without TSV is once again going to be the industry's most cost-effective solution, best ROI solution in the market when we bring it out. And we expect it to be starting volume production in CQ2 in calendar '24. And it's making good progress towards that goal.

And as mentioned earlier, rounding out the HBM discussion to -- for our AI offerings, our HBM -- HBM3, which is sort of the -- call it, the next generation of HBM3, head and shoulders above current HBM3 products in the market in terms of performance, bandwidth, power consumption. We expect that to be in volume production in CQ1 of '24.

So next few months and quarters are going to be very exciting for all of our AI portfolio and the continued ramp of our business in support of the AI offerings.

**Operator**

And our next question comes from the line of Sidney HO from Deutsche Bank.

**Sidney Ho**

Great. I want to go back to the gross margin calculation. Thanks for all the details there. I think, Mark, you mentioned on the call that the fiscal third quarter adjusted gross margin will be 16% -- negative 16%. What would be the same math if we do it for fiscal Q4, including the -- I guess there's some benefit, you talked about $500 million in Q4.

And then kind of related to that, when I think about underutilization, you're now at -- down 30%. You said that will continue to be -- well into fiscal 2024. But then you also talk about period cost staying at $200 million through fiscal Q1 and trail off. Does that mean that the utilization you're expecting to start increasing in fiscal second quarter?

**Mark Murphy**

Yes. So -- so let me cover a few things. If we strip out the utilization or the write-down effects in Q4, we would have a negative gross margin of around -- let me -- hold on one second. I'm just going to -- just give me one second.

**Manish Bhatia**

Maybe while Mark is doing that, Sidney, I can try and answer your question on the wafer start reductions that we talked about. We are reducing wafer starts further from what we had targeted going from 25% to 30%. And then there are -- since we're into the range that Mark talked about, where we're now seeing period costs, that increase from 25% to approaching 30% would be largely captured in period cost increases through some in FQ4 and then into the first half of fiscal '24.

And what we really said was that we're planning on -- we're expecting these reductions in wafer starts to be well into fiscal '24. And we're really just keep them in place for as long as it takes to get the inventories in line, our inventories in line and of course, until we see the industry profitability restored or the trajectory to be restored and then we'll bring -- start to bring that capacity back online.

As we're going through the year, we will also, as we've said before, utilize some of this equipment towards converting to new nodes more capital efficiently, right? So as we have the -- our 1-beta ramp is going to continue as we have our 232-layer ramp is going to continue. We'll be utilizing some of this equipment towards that -- those conversions. And so that all plays into how the period costs and the inventory charges will work as we move to the -- through the second half of the fiscal '24.

**Mark Murphy**

Yes. And Sidney, just -- I wanted to just double check our numbers against the guide. So we had said that we'd get roughly a $500 million benefit for the lower cost inventories passing through. So if we strip that benefit, the gross margin would go from negative 10.5% to over 20% negative. And just -- since we're talking about this, I want to just maybe clear up some confusion because I wanted to -- there's a lot of different views you can take here, and I just want to make sure it's clear.

On a reported basis because we have, obviously, the big charges in the second quarter and the third quarter, and then we don't have charges or don't have write-downs going forward in the forecast, the gross margin was negative 31% in second quarter. It's negative 16% in the reported third quarter.

We've guided to negative 10% -- 10.5%. And we would expect the reported gross margin to continue to improve into fiscal -- gradually into fiscal '24 and then eventually be positive sometime in the second half of fiscal '24.

Now if we -- if you take our non-GAAP gross margin in third quarter of negative 16% and you strip out all the effects, and then you think about, okay, what is the -- what is the effect going forward with all these effects stripped out, I said on the call that under this adjusted view, we trough over the next few quarters, and then we would improve off these low levels through FY '24.

So an example of a troughing is the question you just asked where you strip out the effects and you end up with a negative 20-plus percent gross margin. And we would expect the same effect if you adjusted for the benefit passing through. If you strip that out, we would see the same negative 20-plus percent gross margin in the first quarter, and then it would begin to improve. And then eventually, you're back to normal, there's no more low-cost inventories passing through. But then you pick up just -- you get back in sync with the reported gross margins. And so again, in the second half of the fiscal year, you eventually have positive gross margin. So hopefully, that's clear.

**Sidney Ho**

That's great. Maybe one quick one. If I -- you guys talked about some of your customers considering strategic buys, and we've heard that from some of the OEMs as well. What does that mean to demand -- the demand for your products in future quarters?

Do they just become a pooling of demand into the current -- the next quarter? Or do they -- do the customers lock in a low price, but the delivery is still in the future? Can you just walk us through the different scenarios? That would be great.

**Sumit Sadana**

Typically, we provide the pricing only for the quarter in which the product is shipped. So if a customer is interested in purchasing more than, call it, the natural demand in this quarter, then to get the current price, they would have to take the shipments in this quarter because typically, the price would have to be attached to the time frame for which -- and would have to be competitive and appropriate for the time frame in which the shipments are being made to the customers.

Now sometimes, some customers purchase inventory and pass them at third parties which have a business model to carry these inventories for certain monthly costs, and that has been done in the past. But I will say that the end-to-end inventories are improving and the third-party inventories have gone down substantially over the course of the last few months for both DRAM and NAND, but much more so for DRAM. The reductions in inventories and third parties has been very [Audio Gap] for DRAM in the last [several months]. So -- but this is how we do it with customers.

**Operator**

And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities.

**Vivek Arya**

For my first one, I'm curious, what's your current level of kind of D5 sales and HBM sales exposure? And where do you see it going over the next year?

**Sumit Sadana**

Well, we have provided input that our D5 sales, we expect to continue to increase as our mix of shipments moves more and more towards D5 versus D4. And we have provided some input that we expect our D5 volumes to cross over D4 in our shipments on the end of calendar Q1 in 2024, and we expect the industry D5 shipments to cross over D4 towards the middle of calendar 2024.

So we have been leading the industry in terms of D5 capability, performance, quality and so on for -- since the time D5 was introduced, in fact. And so our mix of D5 continues to be ahead of that of the industry in our business.

As it relates to your question on HBM, we did have volume production of HBM2E, which was the prior generation of HBM. And we got very good learnings out of that, and we got a decent amount of revenue there. But that was towards the tail end of the HBM2E market adoption curve, which moved quite rapidly to HBM3.

And as we mentioned before, our ramp of HBM3, actually the sort of the next generation of HBM3, which is a much higher level of performance bandwidth and lower power than what is in production in HBM3 today in the industry, that product, our industry-leading product will be ramping in volume starting CQ1 of 2024 and will be meaningful in revenue for fiscal year '24 and then substantially larger in 2025, even from those 2024 levels. And we will -- we are targeting a very robust share in HBM higher than our natural supply share for DRAM in the industry.

**Vivek Arya**

Very helpful. And then maybe, Mark, one for you on gross margins. So let's say -- hypothetically, let's say, your Q1 sales, units ASP are all kind of flat sequentially. What happens to gross margins on a reported basis?

**Mark Murphy**

Yes. I'm not going to -- we're not guiding the first quarter, Vivek, but what I will do is provide you -- because we still have price declines forecast in the near term. And however, the market is stabilizing, and then we see prices firming up and improving in the second half. So maybe just take the opportunity here even though, just to maybe do some housekeeping related to your question.

And I give this -- we've given guidance in the fourth quarter, of course, but there's a lot of variability in this market transition phase we're in and then of course, the CAC headwind. But I'll give you a sense of some trends beyond the fourth quarter.

But maybe on bits. In the fourth quarter, we do see record bits shipments for both DRAM and NAND. And both DRAM and NAND will have strong bit growth on a sequential basis. NAND bit growth is a bit higher than DRAM. In the first half of fiscal '24, we see bits at a similar level to fiscal fourth quarter '23 but some quarterly variability due to CAC effects.

Bits should be stronger in the second half of '24 than the first half, of course, as the industry recovery progresses and customer inventories are normalized and as we manage through the CAC effects.

On pricing, pricing in DRAM is better than NAND at the moment in terms of quarter-on-quarter changes. Within the second half of calendar '23, pricing and margins begin stabilizing and increasing. On costs, costs in third quarter were up around mid-single digits in DRAM and NAND, and that's impacted by underutilization. In the fourth quarter, underutilization is going up, but we will see some benefits from cost downs. And so altogether, cost reductions in the fourth quarter are flat to up basically.

On CY '24, underutilization and resulting cost headwinds will continue. And then FY '24, we'll have muted cost reductions despite progress on cost downs. And then of course, all this is -- the pace and timing of wafer start reductions will yes, it depends on the recovery timing. So as volumes increase on wafer starts, of course, the cost will come down on a bit basis. But I think that provides you some profile.

**Farhan Ahmad**

And Mark, if I could -- Vivek, did that answer your question?

**Vivek Arya**

Yes. Actually, what I was really trying to get at is, let's say, if we take the ASP right out of the equation, like what helps gross margins get better sequentially? Is it a reflection of ASP because your utilization is perhaps not going to improve, cost downs don't seem to be changing and the inventory that has been written down, that $500 million number stays flat from Q4 to Q1. So I'm trying to understand what helps gross margins go up sequentially other than ASPs?

**Farhan Ahmad**

Yes. So, I mean, you're right, I mean, there isn't that much moving things left. The cost you were -- as you said, the utilization is still probably not going to come down or the wafer start reduction will not come down. But you will get the benefit of little bit technology penetration increasing, 1-beta continuing to increase. So you'll get some benefit on the cost but not a big shift. The primary driver of our margins is ASP.

**Mark Murphy**

Yes, and Vivek, this is why we're so focused on the supply response because the industry inventory levels need to improve and -- which we have seen broad-based supply response. So we see positive actions there. And we do have forecasted that pricing begins to firm up and then recover in fiscal '24.

**Farhan Ahmad**

Yes. And one more thing Vivek, as we said on the earnings call, the mix between the NAND and DRAM is much bigger variable for our gross margins because the margin difference between the two is very big. So that -- any sensitivity around that can have big changes. So just keep that in mind.

And our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman from BNP Paribas.

**Karl Ackerman**

I was hoping you could remind us how long it typically takes to qualify your products and how that varies between data center and consumer applications?

The reason why I'm asking is, I guess, should we think about the CAC impact and mitigation factors being similar to traditional views of price elasticity such that as long as the memory density and the form factor does not change, then changes can be fairly immediate, or are customers more inclined to make changes on the next product cycle? Any thoughts on that would be super helpful.

**Sumit Sadana**

Sure. Yes. I mean I think there are different scenarios depending on the customer and the product. The most high-volume products that we have, for example, in DRAM are already qualified at multiple customers around the world, and we have a certain share at individual customers that can be flagged up or down depending on customer needs and our own supply and so on.

So in a lot of situations, the products are already qualified. It's a matter of an allocation of share to Micron versus others that our customers go through. And so those type of volume shifts are not dependent on any kind of additional calls taking place.

In some cases, some additional calls may have to happen for the same product going into newer platforms. Those tend to be shorter when the product is already in volume production at a given customer in other SKUs.

Then if there are actual share gains to be had at new customers or new products are to be ramped that have not been broadly qualified before, then those go through a regular qualification cycle. And that qualification cycle, again, varies based on products for client platforms, whether it is SSDs or DRAM. It could be about a quarter, 3 months or so for data center platforms. It tends to be longer both on SSDs and DRAM platforms. So typically, it could take more than 3 months to get qualified. Some cases, 6 months also is possible.

But those are, again, for situations where the product is new or a new generation of DRAM or NAND node is ramping or it's a completely new customer or a completely new application. But in the majority of cases, where mainstream products shipping in volume, we tend to have a fairly broad set of qualifications already done, and it's a matter of share shifts.

**Karl Ackerman**

Got it. No, that's super helpful. If I may ask another follow-up. I guess is your -- is the outlook for calendar '23 bit demand, which has been reduced -- lower this call, is that driven by the recent restrictions on your collective China business? Or is the reduction in demand driven by a view that some customers have stocked up bits at attractive prices. It may take longer to reduce the memory inventory. I just want to -- hoping to clarify that.

**Sumit Sadana**

Sorry, can you repeat what the question -- which reduction are you referring to?

**Manish Bhatia**

The bit demand.

**Sumit Sadana**

The bit demand? Yes.

**Manish Bhatia**

It's really more about, that comment we made -- Sumit, can comment -- can fill in. But the comment we made was for the industry, and it's really driven by some of the reductions in TAM that we see for smartphones and PCs that are both going to have somewhat lower unit sales than what we were forecasting before.

**Sumit Sadana**

Yes. I mean, that CY '23 is not a Micron statement. It is an industry TAM reduction, and it has nothing to do with the CAC. It's to do with a reduction in volume forecast of units. We have reduced our unit shipment estimates for PCs into double digits -- low double digits, that is taking the PC units to a level that is now well below what the PC units were in 2019.

And smartphone units are mid-single-digit percentage decline, which is worse than the low single-digit percentage decline we had estimated earlier. And we have also taken some impact into these TAM numbers related to the inventory reduction rate and pace at the data center customers due to the macro environment in terms of how fast that inventory or how -- the pace of the consumption of that inventory at our customers has also contributed somewhat to the reduction in TAM.

Offsetting just the TAM reduction though is we have increased our estimate for the level of supply reduction that is taking place. So compared to the last cycle, the last quarter, this quarter's estimate -- while the demand has come down, the supply has come down more. And so we do have a view now that both DRAM and NAND supply is -- currently -- the new production is currently running below the shipment levels and consequently, inventories at producers is going down, but also end-to-end inventories in the supply chain are going down.

So customer inventories are improving. Third-party inventories have improved markedly. And certainly, supplier inventories are also improving even as our own volumes are increasing. So the volumes are increasing as an outcome of inventories being reduced throughout the system. And so that's how it's all playing out.

**Farhan Ahmad**

I know we are out of time, but I just wanted to mention if anybody has any questions, the IR team will be here. I know we couldn't get to everyone today. And the modeling in this time period is particularly challenging with all the moving pieces. So if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the IR team.

**Operator**

Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.
